      <h1>webpack finds all relative module references in CSS (they start with ./) and replaces them with the final paths from the compiled bundle. If you make a typo or accidentally delete an important file, you will see a compilation error, like when you import a non-existent JavaScript module. The final filenames in the compiled bundle are generated by webpack from content hashes. If the file content changes in the future, webpack will give it a different name in production so you donâ€™t need to worry about long-term caching of assets.

Please be advised that this is also a custom feature of webpack.</h1>
